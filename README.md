# DiabetesApp
Diabetes Prediction App This is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in a user based on their input parameters. The app uses Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models trained on a diabetes dataset to provide predictions. It includes an intuitive interface for users to input their health metrics and receive results.
# Features
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and interactive web form to input health parameters.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for predictions.
Dual Prediction Results: Outputs predictions from both models for comparison.
Scalable Design: Can be deployed on platforms like Render for real-world use.
# Input Parameters
The app requires the following health metrics to make predictions:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
Glucose Level: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL).
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg).
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
Insulin Level: 2-Hour serum insulin (μU/mL).
BMI: Body mass index (kg/m²).
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A score indicating the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age: Age of the person (years).
